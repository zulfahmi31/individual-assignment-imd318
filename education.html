            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <p>My educational journey began at Tadika Al-Islah As-Salam, where I developed a foundation for learning and curiosity. I then continued my primary education at SK Seri Gedong from 2011 to 2016, where I not only acquired essential academic skills but also discovered my early interest in technology and problem-solving.

               In 2017, I transitioned to SMK Bakar Arang, where I spent the next five years completing my SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia). During my time in secondary school, I became more focused on subjects related to information science and technology, which sparked my interest in the field of information management and computing.

               After completing my SPM, I was offered a place at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Kedah, where I embarked on my Diploma in Information Management. This was an exciting new chapter, as it provided me with a deeper understanding of how information systems work and their critical role in the digital world.

               Currently, I am in my final year of pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Management at UiTM Kedah. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in data management and coding which have laid the foundation for my future career. As I near graduation, I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world settings, especially in areas that combine my passion for technology, problem-solving, and business.</p>

                        <p>Through hard work and dedication, often staying up late into the night, I was able to achieve outstanding results in my SPM. I earned 6 A's out of 8 subjects, a moment I will never forget. This achievement was especially meaningful to me because it was a testament to my perseverance and commitment. More importantly, it was a proud moment for my parents, and I was thrilled to be able to make them proud of my accomplishments. This chapter of my life not only solidified my belief in the value of hard work but also marked a turning point in my academic journey.</p>
