        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Muhammad Zulfahmi bin Zulkifli, a 20-year-old student currently in my final year of studying Information Management at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Sungai Petani branch. I was born in Sungai Petani, Kedah, and I am the third of four siblings in my family.

With a keen interest in information systems, data management, and technology, I have always been fascinated by the way data can be used to solve real-world problems and drive business solutions. Throughout my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in these areas, and I am eager to apply my knowledge in practical settings after graduation.

This website serves as a personal space where I share my academic journey, projects, and aspirations. I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on meaningful projects, and continue learning as I embark on my professional career.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in discussing ideas, collaborations, or have any questions related to my field of study.</p>

I was incredibly excited, as this marked the beginning of my path in higher education—a place where I could not only deepen my knowledge but also start contributing to the academic community. The opportunity to engage with a diverse range of subjects, collaborate with like-minded peers, and learn from experienced lecturers filled me with anticipation. I saw it as a chance to not only shape my future but also to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of information management and technology.</p>

                <h3>My Future</h3>
                <p>In the future, I envision combining my career as a programmer or cybersecurity professional with the entrepreneurial challenge of running a small café. This business would serve as a source of side income, allowing me to explore my passion for both technology and hospitality. By managing a café, I aim to develop valuable skills in business management, customer service, and marketing, while still focusing on my primary career goals in the tech industry. The café would not only provide financial flexibility but also serve as a creative outlet where I can connect with my community and share my love for great food and beverages.</p>
